<p>In programming, understanding the concepts of <strong>objects</strong> and <strong>types</strong> is fundamental. These terms describe how programming languages organize and classify the data that programs work with.</p>

<h2>What is an Object?</h2>

<p>An <strong>object</strong> is a value or piece of data in a program. Every piece of information your program uses—a number, a string of text, a list of items, a true/false value—is an object. Objects are the concrete instances of data that exist in memory while your program runs.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of objects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The number <code>42</code></li>
<li>The string <code>"hello"</code></li>
<li>The value <code>true</code></li>
<li>A list of numbers <code>[1, 2, 3]</code></li>
<li>A collection of key-value pairs mapping names to ages</li>
</ul>

<p>When you write code like <code>x = 5</code>, you're creating an object (the number 5) in yuor computer's memory and referencing it with a variable (<code>x</code>).</p>

<h2>What is a Type?</h2>

<p>A <strong>type</strong> is a classification or category that describes what kind of object something is and what operations can be performed on it. A type determines:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What the object represents:</strong> Is it a number? A piece of text? A collection of items?</li>
<li><strong>What operations are valid:</strong> Can you add it to another object? Can you split it into parts? Can you compare it to something else?</li>
<li><strong>How the object behaves:</strong> What happens when you use different operators with this object?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Types</h2>

There are many types in programming and each will behave in a different way.

<p><strong>Integer:</strong> A type representing whole numbers. With integers, you can perform arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide), compare them (greater than, less than), and check equality.</p>

<p><strong>String:</strong> A type representing text (sequences of characters). With strings, you can concatenate them (join them together), extract individual characters, measure their length, and compare them alphabetically.</p>

<p><strong>Boolean:</strong> A type with only two possible values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Booleans are used to represent truth values and are essential for making decisions in programs.</p>

<p><strong>List:</strong> A type representing an ordered collection of items. With lists, you can access individual items by position, add or remove items, and iterate through all items.</p>

<h2>The Relationship Between Objects and Types</h2>

<p>Every object belongs to exactly one type. The type tells you what the object is and how you can work with it. When you create an object, you implicitly create it with a specific type:</p>

<p><code>7</code> is an object of type <code>Integer</code><br>
<code>"hello"</code> is an object of type <code>String</code><br>
<code>true</code> is an object of type <code>Boolean</code><br>
<code>[1, 2, 3]</code> is an object of type <code>List</code></p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>

<p>Understanding types helps prevent errors. Many programming operations only make sense for certain types. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can add two numbers, but you can't directly add a number to a string</li>
<li>You can check if one string comes before another alphabetically, but that question doesn't make sense for numbers</li>
<li>You can access the first item in a list, but there is no "first item" in a number</li>
</ul>
